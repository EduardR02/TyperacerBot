# Typeracer Bot  
This bot types around 300 to 400 wpm in Typeracer and does not get detected as a cheater  
You can alter the specific speed settings at the very bottom of repeat_part() by changing the values in   
time.sleep(random.randint()) or the increment above, which is the amount of letters typed at the same time  
The bot will take you to the homepage and all you need to do is type q and hit Enter in the console which will start the race,  
so you can just return to the homepage after the race and repeat
